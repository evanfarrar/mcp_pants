== MCPPANTS

This is a server wrapper and administration tool for minecraft. Currently it can:
  - Maintain the configuration of worlds (mobs, nether, port)
  - Teleport (via talk and web interface)
  - Server and Chat logs in the web interface
  - Player profiles
  - Time of Day (so you know if you're connecting at night)
