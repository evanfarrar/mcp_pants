MCPPANTS --- Helping minecraft one leg at a time.
===================

This is mcp_pants, a server wrapper and administration tool for minecraft. Currently it can:

* Maintain the configuration of worlds (mobs, nether, port)
* Teleport (via talk and web interface)
* Server and Chat logs in the web interface
* Player profiles
* Display time of Day (so you know if you're connecting at night)
* Give a "Message of the Day" announcement to players when they sign on.

Available Chat Commands
------------------------
* *!t curlybro*
  * Moves you to where curlybro is. You can type any unique beginning of another player's name. If no one on the server had a name beginning with "c" typing merely *!t c* would work.
* *!motd happy leif erikson day! Let's go sailing west in search of pumpkins!*
  * Sets the 'message of the day' to this blurb. Everyone who signs on will get this whispered to them.
